## Library Management System
This project is a Library Management System developed in Java, which allows you to manage users, books, loans, reservations and fines. Key features include:

- Registration of users and books.
- Carrying out borrows and returns with controlled deadlines.
- Automatic calculation of fines for late returns.
- Book reservation management.

#### The system uses a MySQL database to store information and follows Object Orientation principles.
#### I plan to make a graphical interface later, but i'll focus on business logic and cruds, as I will not use frameworks for this project.

### Still working on
